# PYTHON -> ACESS SET ITEMS

r"""
Acess Items
You cannot acess items in a set by referring to an index or a key.
But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

"""

thisset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
for x in thisset:
    print(x)

"""
banana
cherry
apple

"""

thisset = {"apple","banana","cherry"}
print("banana" in thisset)

#OUTPUT: True


thisset = {"apple","banana","cherry"}
print("banana" not in thisset)


#OUTPUT: False
