#Python- Variable Names
"""
Variable Names:
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name(age,carname,total_volume).
# RULES for Python variables:
-> A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
-> A variable name cannot start with a number
-> Variable names are case-sensitive (age,Age and AGE are three different variables)
-> A variable name can only contain alpha-numneric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9 and _)
-> A variable name cannot be any of the Python Keywords.
